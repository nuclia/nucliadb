Atomic datamanagers

This module aims to provide a simple way to call a datamanager function in a
single transaction, avoiding the need of encapsulating like in this example:

```
async def <function>(...):
    async with datamanagers.with_transaction() as txn:
        await datamanagers.<module>.<function>(...)
```

Or simply a more handy way to call an datamanager operation without caring about
it's transaction
