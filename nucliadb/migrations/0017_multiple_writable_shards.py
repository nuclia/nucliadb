"""Migration #17

Change how we track active (writable) shrads for a KB. Right now we use the
`writer_pb2.Shards.actual` to point the position of the current shard in the
list of shards.

The migration changes this to a flag in each `writer_pb2.ShardObject`, so in the
future multiple writable shards will be possible.
