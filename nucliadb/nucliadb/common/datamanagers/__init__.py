# Rules for datamanagers:
#   - Try to be consistent
#   - All datamanagers should be imported in __init__.py
#   - Manage keys of K/V Storage and try not to leak them
#   - Transactions are managed OUTSIDE of the datamanagers module
#   - There shouldn't be ANY db commits in the datamanagers module, that is handled outside right now.
#   - Module level functions only
#   - First argument is always a transaction, all other arguments are keyword arguments and must be explicit
#     (better for readability and code editors)
