### FILTERS

Filters can be used to narrow down the scope of a search query, whereas facets are typically used to get category counts on search results.

NucliaDB implements its own syntax for filters and facets based on "tags". This section aims to describe the complete list of tags available by providing some examples.

The hierarchy of tags is the following:

- `/t`: user provided tags
  - Example: `/t/blue`, `/t/green`

- `/l`: user and processor provided labels: `/l/{labelset}/{label}`
  - Example: `/l/movie-genre/science-fiction`

- `/n`: miscellaneous resource metadata labels
  - `/n/i`: mime type of resource
    - Example filters: `/n/i/application/pdf` or `/n/i/movie/mp4`

  - `/n/s`: processing status
    - Example facet results: `/n/s/PROCESSED`, `/n/s/PENDING` or `/n/s/ERROR`

- `/e`: document entities as `/e/{entity-type}/{entity-id}`
  - Example: `/e/CITY/Barcelona`

- `/s`: languages(`s` for speech)
  - `/s/p`: primary language of the document
    - Example: `/s/p/ca` for catalan language
  - `/s/s`: all other detected languages
    - Example: `/s/s/tr` for turkish language

- `/u`: contributors/users/sources
  - `/u/s`: Origin source
    - Example: `/u/s/WEB`
  - `/u/o`: Origin contributors
    - Example: `/u/o/username`

- `/f`: field keyword field (field/keyword)
  - Example: `/f/fieldname/value`

- `/fg`: flat field keywords
  - Example: `/fg/value`
