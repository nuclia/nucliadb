As a data scientist or NLP engineer your hard-drive is probably full of datasets and corpora. If you have found yourself crashing a notebook trying to load something too big with Pandas, doing gymnastics in your shell just to explore your data or just not really knowing how to perform robust search through your dataset, this is a tool for you.

NucliaDB is written in Rust and Python and built on top of the [tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) library. We designed it to index large datasets and provide multi-teanant suport.


# Features
- Compare the vectors from different models in an easy way
- Store text, files, vectors, labels and annotations
- Access and modify your resources efficiently
- Annotate your resources
- Perform text searches and given a word or set of words, return resources in our database that contain them.
- Perform semantic searches with vectors. For example, given a set of vectors, return the closest matches in our database. With NLP, this allows us to look for similar sentences without being constrained by exact keywords.
- Export your data in a format compatible with most NLP pipelines (HuggingFace datasets, pytorch, etc)
- Store original data, extracting and data pulled from the Understanding API
- Index fields, paragraphs, and semantic sentences on index storage
- Cloud data and insight extraction with the Nuclia Understanding API‚Ñ¢
- Cloud connection to train ML models with Nuclia Learning API‚Ñ¢
- Role based security system with upstream proxy authentication validation
- Resources with multiple fields and metadata
- Text/HTML/Markdown plain fields support
- File field support with direct upload and TUS upload
- Link field support
- Conversation field support
- Blocks/Layout field support
- Eventual consistency transactions based on Nats.io
- Distributed storage layer support with TiKV and Redis support
- PostgreSQL storage layer support for standalone installs
- Blob support with S3-compatible API, GCS and PG drivers
- Replication of index storage
- Distributed search
- Cloud-native

# üôã FAQ

## How is NucliaDB different from traditional search engines like Elasticsearch or Solr?

The core difference and advantage of NucliaDB is its architecture built from the ground up for unstructured data. Its vector index, keyword, graph and fuzzy search provide an API to use all extracted and extracted information from Nuclia, Understanding API and provides powerful NLP abilities to any application with low code and peace of mind.

## What license does NucliaDB use?

NucliaDB is open-source under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 - AGPLv3. Fundamentally, this means that you are free to use NucliaDB for your project, as long as you don't modify NucliaDB. If you do, you have to make the modifications public.

## What is Nuclia's business model?

Our business model relies on our normalization API, this one is based on `Nuclia Learning API` and `Nuclia Understanding API`. This two APIs offers transformation of unstructured data to NucliaDB compatible data with AI. We also offer NucliaDB as a service at our multi-cloud provider infrastructure: [https://nuclia.cloud](https://nuclia.cloud).
