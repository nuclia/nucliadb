    one of the deployment fixtures (e.g. `component_nucliadb_reader`). This
    replacement allows multiple advantages:
    - use a common `nucliadb_reader` fixture for all kind of deployments
    - lazily call dependent fixtures

    Furthemore, as we are not actually replacing fixtures but parametrizing its
    name, we can mark multiple deployment modes an run tests multiple times, one
